# Tomorrow's News Today!

Welcome to the README.md for our Group Project with CTA.
Team Members include:
- Natalia 
- Imogen 
- Chidubem 
- Gabriel 

Our project is called *TNT News - Tomorrow's News Today*, featuring news from all  time: past, present and future. 

# Team Standards:

We will operate with a Scrum/Kanban method, featuring 5 day sprints and changing scrum masters every 5 days 

- Anti semi-colons
- Descriptive names for variables, functions, components and comments in files 
- Clear, descriptive, minimal Git commit messages 
- GitHub branch names should link to Ticket name for clarity 
- Branches need to by hyper-specific to the task that is being completed  

# Rules:
- Everyone works on own branch
- Git checkout 'y/n-branch' before pushing 
- No merging into main until we are all present and can minimise merge conflicts together 
- Daily scrum meetings with scrum master leading by talking through tickets 
- FUN!
